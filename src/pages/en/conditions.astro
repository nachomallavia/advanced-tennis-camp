        <p>
          By booking a camp or sports activity on the website www.advancedtenniscamp.ch, parents or legal guardians agree to accept the following terms and conditions.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Arrivals and Departures</h2>
        <p>
          Participants are supervised by coaches from 8:45 AM at Restaurant chez Martin every day until the end of activities. An adult must accompany each child to the camp reception and sign the attendance sheet, and return to pick up each child at the end of activities and sign a departure sheet. Unaccompanied minors are not allowed to leave the camp except those with written and signed authorization from parents or legal guardians.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boarding participants are welcomed and supervised from Sunday 4:00 PM until Saturday 12:30 PM.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Insurance</h2>
        <p>
          Participants must be insured against accident risks that may occur during the camps as well as for civil liability. For children residing abroad, health and accident insurance and civil liability insurance for Switzerland must be mandatory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advanced Tennis Camps assumes no responsibility in case of accident, nor any responsibility for loss, theft, or damage to participants' personal belongings.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Accidents and Illnesses</h2>
        <p>
          In case of accident while supervising a participant, parents or legal guardians authorize the coach providing the service to take all useful measures in the interest of the person, including calling emergency medical services if necessary. Related costs will be the responsibility of parents or legal guardians. In case of need, emergency, or illness, the camp team will call parents or legal guardians immediately.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Cancellation</h2>

          Given current health circumstances, cancellations will be accepted up to 72 hours in advance and must be justified by a medical certificate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any camp that has started is due, except in case of a medical problem occurring during the camp requiring the participant's departure. In this case, a "camp credit" valid for the current season or the following year will be opened, equivalent to the number of remaining days.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Parents or legal guardians acknowledge that in case of non-compliance with said rules, or due to attitudes or behaviors representing a risk to the safety and/or well-being of other camp participants, participants may be excluded from the camp without being entitled to a refund or any compensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coaches may also ask a participant to stop the activity if their technical level or physical condition compromises their health or the safety of the group or the proper conduct of the course.
        </p>
