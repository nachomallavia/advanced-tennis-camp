# Progress: Advanced Tennis Camp

## What Works
- Basic Astro project structure.
- Multi-language routing.
- Initial UI components (Starwind UI).
- Unified color palette using `neutral` instead of `gray`.
- Optimized font loading (removed Raleway, using Archivo only).

- `CampHero.astro` section component for camp information pages.
- `Feature71.astro` with interactive direction-aware hover effects using Anime.js v4.
- `DirectionAwareHover` reusable React component.

## What's Left to Build
- Add animations to `CampHero.astro`.
- Further Aceternity UI-style components using Anime.js v4.
- Any other requested interactive features.

## Current Status
